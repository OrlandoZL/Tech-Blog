# Tech-Blog

## Description

This is supposed to be an app that allows a user to create a blog post. This project consisted of a bunch of technologies such as bcrypt, connect-session- sequelize , dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, handlebars, mysql2, and sequelize. The motivation behind this project was to use a lot of the technologies we've learned and put it into one. I haven't finished this project but am working on finishing it as soon as possible.
